# This file contains SHAs of changes that should be ignored when e.g.
# running `git blame` on a file. Do not edit any of the existing commits.
#
# Use this file by running:
#
#     git blame --ignore-revs-file=.git-blame-ignore-rev <file>
#
# or by configuring `blame.ignoreRevsFile`. The latter ought to also work
# with IDEs such as CLion.
