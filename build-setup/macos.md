# Machine Learning Build Machine Setup for macOS

To ensure everything is consistent for redistributable builds we build all redistributable components from source.

NOTE: if you upgrade macOS then Xcode may need to be re-installed. Please ensure your Xcode is still valid after upgrades.

You will need the following environment variables to be defined:

- `JAVA_HOME` - Should point to the JDK you want to use to run Gradle.
- `CPP_SRC_HOME` - Only required if building the C++ code directly using `make`, as Gradle sets it automatically.
- `PATH` - Must have `/usr/local/bin` before `/usr/bin` and `/bin`.

For example, you might create a `.bashrc` file in your home directory containing something like this:

```
umask 0002
export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_121.jdk/Contents/Home
export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin
# Only required if building the C++ code directly using make - adjust depending on the location of your Git clone
export CPP_SRC_HOME=$HOME/ml-cpp
```

Note, that bash doesn't read `~/.bashrc` for login shells (which is what you get when you open a new Terminal window) - it reads `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.profile` so you should probably also create a `.bash_profile` file in your home directory which sources `.bashrc`.

### General settings for building the tools

Some tools may be built via a GNU "configure" script. There are some environment variables that affect the behaviour of this. Therefore, when building ANY tool on macOS, set the following environment variables:

```
export CPP='clang -E'
export CC=clang
export CFLAGS='-O3 -msse4.2'
export CXX='clang++ -std=c++17 -stdlib=libc++'
export CXXFLAGS='-O3 -msse4.2'
export CXXCPP='clang++ -std=c++17 -E'
export LDFLAGS=-Wl,-headerpad_max_install_names
unset CPATH
unset C_INCLUDE_PATH
unset CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH
unset LIBRARY_PATH
```

The above environment variables only need to be set when building tools on macOS. They should NOT be set when compiling the Machine Learning source code (as this should pick up all settings from our Makefiles).

### Xcode

The first major piece of development software to install is Apple's development environment, Xcode, which can be downloaded from <https://developer.apple.com/download/> . You will need to register as a developer with Apple. Alternatively, you can get the latest version of Xcode from the App Store.

For C++17 Xcode 10 is required, and this requires macOS High Sierra or above. Therefore you must be running macOS High Sierra (10.13) or above to build the Machine Learning C++ code.

- If you are using High Sierra, you must install Xcode 10.1.x
- If you are using Mojave or Catalina, you must install Xcode 11.2.x

Xcode is distributed as a `.xip` file; simply double click the `.xip` file to expand it, then drag `Xcode.app` to your `/Applications` directory.
(Older versions of Xcode can be downloaded from [here](https://developer.apple.com/download/more/), provided you are signed in with your Apple ID.)

There are no command line tools out-of-the-box, so you'll need to install them following installation of Xcode. You can do this by running:

```
xcode-select --install
```

at the command prompt.

### Boost 1.71.0

Download version 1.71.0 of Boost from <https://dl.bintray.com/boostorg/release/1.71.0/source/boost_1_71_0.tar.bz2>. You must get this exact version, as the Machine Learning Makefiles expect it.

Assuming you chose the `.bz2` version, extract it to a temporary directory:

```
bzip2 -cd boost_1_71_0.tar.bz2 | tar xvf -
```

In the resulting `boost_1_71_0` directory, run:

```
./bootstrap.sh --with-toolset=clang --without-libraries=context --without-libraries=coroutine --without-libraries=graph_parallel --without-libraries=mpi --without-libraries=python --without-icu
```

This should build the `b2` program, which in turn is used to build Boost.

Edit `boost/unordered/detail/implementation.hpp` and change line 287 from:

```
    (17ul)(29ul)(37ul)(53ul)(67ul)(79ul) \
```

to:

```
    (3ul)(17ul)(29ul)(37ul)(53ul)(67ul)(79ul) \
```

To complete the build, type:

```
./b2 -j8 --layout=versioned --disable-icu cxxflags="-std=c++17 -stdlib=libc++ -msse4.2" linkflags="-std=c++17 -stdlib=libc++ -Wl,-headerpad_max_install_names" optimization=speed inlining=full define=BOOST_MATH_NO_LONG_DOUBLE_MATH_FUNCTIONS define=BOOST_LOG_WITHOUT_DEBUG_OUTPUT define=BOOST_LOG_WITHOUT_EVENT_LOG define=BOOST_LOG_WITHOUT_SYSLOG define=BOOST_LOG_WITHOUT_IPC
sudo ./b2 install --layout=versioned --disable-icu cxxflags="-std=c++17 -stdlib=libc++ -msse4.2" linkflags="-std=c++17 -stdlib=libc++ -Wl,-headerpad_max_install_names" optimization=speed inlining=full define=BOOST_MATH_NO_LONG_DOUBLE_MATH_FUNCTIONS define=BOOST_LOG_WITHOUT_DEBUG_OUTPUT define=BOOST_LOG_WITHOUT_EVENT_LOG define=BOOST_LOG_WITHOUT_SYSLOG define=BOOST_LOG_WITHOUT_IPC
```

to install the Boost headers and libraries.
