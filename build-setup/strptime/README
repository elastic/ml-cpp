They must be patched before they'll compile on Windows, using the patches in
this directory.  For Visual Studio 2015 and above, use the "ucrt" version of
the patch for strptime.c.

Then build using these commands in the appropriate Visual Studio command
prompt:

cl -c -nologo -O2 -Oi -MD -DWIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN -DNDEBUG strptime.c
lib -NOLOGO strptime.obj
