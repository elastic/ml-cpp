MICROSOFT VISUAL STUDIO ENTERPRISE 2019, VISUAL STUDIO PROFESSIONAL 2019,
VISUAL STUDIO TEST PROFESSIONAL 2019 AND TRIAL EDITION

These license terms are an agreement between you and Microsoft Corporation (or
based on where you live, one of its affiliates). They apply to the software
named above. The terms also apply to any Microsoft services and updates for the
software, except to the extent those have different terms.
BY USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THEM, DO NOT
USE THE SOFTWARE. INSTEAD, RETURN IT TO THE RETAILER FOR A REFUND OR CREDIT. If
you cannot obtain a refund there, contact Microsoft about Microsoft's refund
policies. See www.microsoft.com/worldwide. In the United States and Canada, call
(800) MICROSOFT or see aka.ms/nareturns.

TRIAL EDITION USE RIGHTS. If you have not acquired a valid full-use license, the
software is a trial edition, and this Section applies to your use of the trial
edition.
A.	GENERAL. You may use any number of copies of the trial edition on your
devices. You may only use the trial edition for internal evaluation
purposes, and only during the trial period. You may not distribute or
deploy any applications you make with the trial edition to a production
environment. You may run load tests of up to 250 virtual users during the
trial period.
B.	TRIAL PERIOD AND CONVERSION. The trial period lasts for 30 days after you
install the trial edition, plus any permitted extension period. After the
expiration of the trial period, the trial edition will stop running. You
may extend the trial period an additional 90 days if you sign in to the
software. You may not be able to access data used with the trial edition
after it stops running. You may convert your trial rights at any time to
the full-use rights described below by acquiring a valid full-use license.
C.	DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE TRIAL EDITION IS LICENSED "AS-IS".  YOU BEAR
THE RISK OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES OR
CONDITIONS. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS, MICROSOFT
EXCLUDES THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
FOR AUSTRALIA - YOU HAVE STATUTORY GUARANTEES UNDER THE AUSTRALIAN
CONSUMER LAW AND NOTHING IN THESE TERMS IS INTENDED TO AFFECT THOSE
RIGHTS.
D.	SUPPORT. Because the trial edition is "as is", we may not provide support
services for it.
E.	LIMITATIONS ON DAMAGES. YOU CAN RECOVER FROM MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS
ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S. $5.00. YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER
DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.
This limitation applies to (a) anything related to the trial version,
services, content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third
party programs; and (b) claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty,
guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the
extent permitted by applicable law.
It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the
possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not
apply to you because your country may not allow the exclusion or
limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.

FULL-USE LICENSE TERMS FOR THE SOFTWARE: When you acquire a valid license and
either enter a product key or sign in to the software, the terms below apply.
You may not share your product key or access credentials.
1.	OVERVIEW.
a.	Software. The software includes development tools, applications, and
documentation.
b.	License Model. The software is licensed on a per user basis.
2.	USE RIGHTS.
a.	General. One user may use copies of the software on your devices to
develop and test applications. This includes using copies of the software
on your own internal servers that remain fully dedicated to your own use.
You may not, however, separate the components of the software (except as
otherwise stated in this agreement) and run those in a production
environment, or on third party devices, or for any purpose other than
developing and testing your applications. Running the software on
Microsoft Azure may require separate online usage fees.
b.	Workloads. These license terms apply to your use of the workloads made
available to you within the software, except to the extent a workload or a
workload component comes with different license terms and support
policies.
c.	Backup copy. You may make one backup copy of the software, for
reinstalling the software.
d.	Online Services in the Software. Some features of the software make use of
online services to provide you with information about updates to the
software or extensions, or to enable you to retrieve content, collaborate
with others, or otherwise supplement your development experience. As used
throughout this agreement, the term "software" includes these online
service features.
e.	Demo Use. The use rights permitted above include using the software to
demonstrate your applications.
3.	TERMS FOR SPECIFIC COMPONENTS.
a.	Utilities. The software contains items on the Utilities List at
https://aka.ms/vs/16/utilities. You may copy and install those items onto
your devices to debug and deploy your applications and databases you
developed with the software. The Utilities are designed for temporary use.
Microsoft may not be able to patch or update Utilities separately from the
rest of the software.  Some Utilities by their nature may make it possible
for others to access the devices on which the Utilities are installed. You
should delete all Utilities you have installed after you finish debugging
or deploying your applications and databases. Microsoft is not responsible
for any third party use or access of devices, or of the applications or
databases on devices, on which Utilities have been installed.
b.	Build Devices and Visual Studio Build Tools.  You may copy and install
files from the software or from Visual Studio Build Tools onto your build
devices, including physical devices and virtual machines or containers on
those machines, whether on-premises or remote machines that are owned by
you, hosted on Microsoft Azure for you, or dedicated solely to your use
(collectively, "Build Devices").  You and others in your organization may
use these files on your Build Devices solely to compile, build, and verify
applications developed by using the software, or run quality or
performance tests of those applications as part of the build process.
c.	Font Components. While the software is running, you may use its fonts to
display and print content. You may only: (i) embed fonts in content as
permitted by the embedding restrictions in the fonts; and (ii) temporarily
download them to a printer or other output device to help print content.
d.	Licenses for Other Components.
*	Microsoft Platforms. The software may include components from Microsoft
Windows, Microsoft Windows Server, Microsoft SQL Server, Microsoft
Exchange, Microsoft Office, or Microsoft SharePoint. These components
are governed by separate agreements and their own product support
policies, as described in the Microsoft "Licenses" folder accompanying
the software, except that, if separate license terms for those
components are included in the associated installation directly, those
license terms control.
*	Third Party Components. The software may include third party components
with separate legal notices or governed by other agreements, as may be
described in the ThirdPartyNotices file(s) accompanying the software.
e.	Package Managers. The software includes package managers, like NuGet, that
give you the option to download other Microsoft and third party software
packages to use with your applications. Those packages are under their own
licenses, and not these license terms. Microsoft does not distribute,
license or provide any warranties for any of the third party packages.
4.	DISTRIBUTABLE CODE. The software contains code that you are permitted to
distribute in applications you develop as described in this Section. For
purposes of this Section 4, the term "distribution" also means deployment of
your applications for third parties to access over the Internet.
a.	Right to Use and Distribute. The code and text files listed below are
"Distributable Code".
*	Distributable List. You may copy and distribute the object code form of
code listed on the Distributable List located at
https://aka.ms/vs/16/redistribution.
*	Sample Code, Templates, and Styles. You may copy, modify, and
distribute the source and object code form of code marked as "sample",
"template", "simple styles", and "sketch styles".
*	Third Party Distribution. You may permit distributors of your
applications to copy and distribute the Distributable Code as part of
those applications.
b.	Distribution Requirements. For any Distributable Code you distribute, you
must:
*	add significant primary functionality to it in your applications;
*	require distributors and external end users to agree to terms that
protect the Distributable Code at least as much as this agreement; and
*	indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Microsoft from any claims,
including attorneys' fees, related to the distribution or use of your
applications, except to the extent that any claim is based solely on
the Distributable Code.
c.	Distribution Restrictions. You may not:
*	use Microsoft's trademarks in your applications' names or in a way that
suggests your applications come from or are endorsed by Microsoft; or
*	modify or distribute the source code of any Distributable Code so that
any part of it becomes subject to an Excluded License. An Excluded
License is one that requires, as a condition of use, modification or
distribution of code, that (i) it be disclosed or distributed in source
code form; or (ii) others have the right to modify it.
5.	DEVELOPING EXTENSIONS.
a.	Limits on Extensions. You may not develop or enable others to develop
extensions for the software (or any other component of the Visual Studio
family of products) which circumvent the technical limitations implemented
in the software. If Microsoft technically limits or disables extensibility
for the software, you may not extend the software by, among other things,
loading or injecting into the software any non-Microsoft add-ins, macros,
or packages; modifying the software registry settings; or adding features
or functionality equivalent to that found in the Visual Studio family of
products.
b.	No Degrading the Software. If you develop an extension for the software
(or any other component of the Visual Studio family of products), you must
test the installation, uninstallation, and operation of your extension to
ensure that such processes do not disable any features or adversely affect
the functionality of the software (or such component) or of any previous
version or edition of thereof.
6.	DATA.
a.	Data Collection. The software may collect information about you and your
use of the software, and send that to Microsoft. Microsoft may use this
information to provide services and improve our products and services. You
may opt out of many of these scenarios, but not all, as described in the
software documentation. There are also some features in the software that
may enable you and Microsoft to collect data from users of your
applications. If you use these features, you must comply with applicable
law, including providing appropriate notices to users of your applications
together with Microsoft's privacy statement. Our privacy statement is
located at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=824704. You can learn
more about data collection and its use from the software documentation and
our privacy statement. Your use of the software operates as your consent
to these practices.
b.	Processing of Personal Data. To the extent Microsoft is a processor or
subprocessor of personal data in connection with the software, Microsoft
makes the commitments in the European Union General Data Protection
Regulation Terms of the Online Services Terms to all customers effective
May 25, 2018, at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/gdpr.
7.	SCOPE OF LICENSE. The software is licensed, not sold. These license terms
only give you some rights to use the software. Microsoft reserves all other
rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation,
you may use the software only as expressly permitted in these license terms.
In doing so, you must comply with any technical limitations in the software
that only allow you to use it in certain ways. In addition, you may not:
*	work around any technical limitations in the software;
*	reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, or otherwise
attempt to derive the source code for the software, except and to the
extent required by third party licensing terms governing use of certain
open source components that may be included in the software;
*	remove, minimize, block, or modify any notices of Microsoft or its
suppliers in the software;
*	use the software in any way that is against the law;
*	share, publish, rent, or lease the software; or
*	provide the software as a stand-alone offering or combine it with any of
your applications for others to use.
8.	NOT FOR RESALE SOFTWARE. You may not sell the software if it is marked as
"NFR" or "Not for Resale".
9.	PREVIOUS VERSIONS OR OTHER EDITIONS. These license terms do not supersede
your right to use validly licensed previous versions or other editions of
the software. You may use the software and those previous versions or other
editions of the software concurrently.
10.	PROOF OF LICENSE. If you acquired the software on a disc or other media,
your proof of license is the Microsoft certificate of authenticity label,
the accompanying product key, and your receipt. If you purchased an online
copy of the software, your proof of license is the Microsoft product key you
received with your purchase and your receipt and/or being able to access the
software service through your Microsoft account. To identify genuine
Microsoft software, see www.howtotell.com.
11.	TRANSFER TO A THIRD PARTY. If you are a valid licensee of the software, you
may transfer it and this agreement directly to another party. Before the
transfer, that party must agree that these license terms apply to the
transfer and use of the software. The transfer must include the software,
this agreement, the genuine Microsoft product key, and (if applicable) the
Proof of License label. The transferor must uninstall all copies of the
software after transferring it from the device. The transferor may not
retain any copies of the genuine Microsoft product key to be transferred,
and may only retain copies of the software if otherwise licensed to do so.
If you have acquired a non-perpetual license to use the software or if the
software is marked Not for Resale you may not transfer the software or the
software license agreement to another party.
12.	EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. You must comply with all domestic and international
export laws and regulations that apply to the software, which include
restrictions on destinations, end users, and end use. For further
information on export restrictions, visit www.microsoft.com/exporting.
13.	SUPPORT. Microsoft provides support for the software as described at
https://support.microsoft.com.
14.	ENTIRE AGREEMENT. These license terms (including the warranty below), and
the terms for supplements, updates, Internet-based services, and support
services, are the entire agreement for the software and support services.
15.	APPLICABLE LAW. If you acquired the software in the United States,
Washington State law applies to interpretation of and claims for breach of
this agreement, and the laws of the state where you live apply to all other
claims. If you acquire the software in any other country, its laws apply.
16.	CONSUMER RIGHTS; REGIONAL VARIATIONS. These license terms describe certain
legal rights. You may have other rights, including consumer rights, under
the laws of your state or country. You may also have rights with respect to
the party from which you acquired the software. This agreement does not
change those other rights if the laws of your state or country do not permit
it to do so. For example, if you acquired the software in one of the below
regions, or if mandatory country law applies, then the following provisions
apply to you:
a)	Australia. References to "Limited Warranty" are references to the express
warranty provided by Microsoft. This warranty is given in addition to
other rights and remedies you may have under law, including your rights
and remedies in accordance with the statutory guarantees in the Australian
Consumer Law.
In this section, "goods" refers to the software for which Microsoft
provides the express warranty. Our goods come with guarantees that cannot
be excluded under the Australian Consumer Law. You are entitled to a
replacement or refund for a major failure and compensation for any other
reasonably foreseeable loss or damage. You are also entitled to have the
goods repaired or replaced if the goods fail to be of acceptable quality
and the failure does not amount to a major failure.
b)	Canada. You may stop receiving updates on your device by turning off
Internet access.  If and when you re-connect to the Internet, the software
will resume checking for and installing updates.
c)	Germany and Austria.
(i)	Warranty. The properly licensed software will perform substantially
as described in any Microsoft materials that accompany the software.
However, Microsoft gives no contractual guarantee in relation to the
software.
(ii)	Limitation of Liability. In case of intentional conduct, gross
negligence, claims based on the Product Liability Act, as well as, in the
case of death or personal or physical injury, Microsoft is liable
according to the statutory law.
Subject to the preceding sentence (ii), Microsoft will only be liable for
slight negligence if Microsoft is in breach of such material contractual
obligations, the fulfillment of which facilitate the due performance of
this agreement, the breach of which would endanger the purpose of this
agreement and the compliance with which a party may constantly trust in
(so-called "cardinal obligations"). In other cases of slight negligence,
Microsoft will not be liable for slight negligence.

*************************************************************************
LIMITED WARRANTY
Microsoft warrants that properly licensed software will perform substantially as
described in any Microsoft materials that accompany the software. This limited
warranty does not cover problems that you cause, that arise when you fail to
follow instructions, or that are caused by events beyond Microsoft's reasonable
control. The limited warranty starts when the first user acquires the software,
and lasts for one year. Any supplements, updates, or replacement software that
you may receive from Microsoft during that year are also covered, but only for
the remainder of that one-year period or for 30 days, whichever is longer.
Transferring the software will not extend the limited warranty.
Microsoft gives no other express warranties, guarantees, or conditions.
Microsoft excludes all implied warranties and conditions, including those of
merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. If your
local law does not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, then any implied
warranties, guarantees, or conditions last only during the term of the limited
warranty and are limited as much as your local law allows. If your local law
requires a longer limited warranty term, despite this agreement, then that
longer term will apply, but you can recover only the remedies this agreement
allows.
If Microsoft breaches its limited warranty, it will, at its election, either:
(i) repair or replace the software at no charge, or (ii) accept return of the
software (or at its election the Microsoft branded device on which the software
was preinstalled) for a refund of the amount paid, if any. These are your only
remedies for breach of warranty. This limited warranty gives you specific legal
rights, and you may also have other rights which vary from state to state or
country to country.
Except for any repair, replacement, or refund Microsoft may provide, you may not
recover under this limited warranty, under any other part of this agreement, or
under any theory, any damages or other remedy, including lost profits or direct,
consequential, special, indirect, or incidental damages. The damage exclusions
and remedy limitations in this agreement apply even if repair, replacement or a
refund does not fully compensate you for any losses, if Microsoft knew or should
have known about the possibility of the damages, or if the remedy fails of its
essential purpose. Some states and countries do not allow the exclusion or
limitation of incidental, consequential, or other damages, so those limitations
or exclusions may not apply to you. If your local law allows you to recover
damages from Microsoft even though this agreement does not, you cannot recover
more than you paid for the software (or up to $50 USD if you acquired the
software for no charge).

Warranty Procedures
For service or a refund, you must provide a copy of your proof of purchase and
comply with Microsoft's return policies, which might require you to uninstall
the software and return it to Microsoft or return the software with the entire
Microsoft branded device on which the software is installed; the certificate of
authenticity label including the product key (if provided with your device) must
remain affixed.
1.        United States and Canada. For limited warranty service or information
about how to obtain a refund for software acquired in the United States or
Canada, contact Microsoft via telephone at (800) MICROSOFT; via mail at
Microsoft Customer Service and Support, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052-
6399; or visit (aka.ms/nareturns).
2.        Europe, Middle East, and Africa. If you acquired the software in
Europe, the Middle East, or Africa, Microsoft Ireland Operations Limited makes
the limited warranty. To make a claim under the limited warranty, you must
contact either Microsoft Ireland Operations Limited, Customer Care Centre,
Atrium Building Block B, Carmanhall Road, Sandyford Industrial Estate, Dublin
18, Ireland, or the Microsoft affiliate serving your country (aka.ms/msoffices).
3.        Australia. If you acquired the software in Australia, contact
Microsoft to make a claim at 13 20 58; or Microsoft Pty Ltd, 1 Epping Road,
North Ryde NSW 2113 Australia.
4.	Other countries. If you acquired the software in another country, contact
the Microsoft affiliate serving your country (aka.ms/msoffices).
