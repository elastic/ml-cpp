//! \brief
//! Retrieves data from a single C++ stream.
//!
//! DESCRIPTION:\n
//! Retrieves data from a single C++ stream.
//!
//! The format must consist of one or more blocks of input in the
//! format returned by Elasticsearch's get API, separated by zero
//! bytes ('\0').  This class will return the same stream for
//! every search.  The caller must not close the stream.
//!
//! Implements the CDataSearcher interface for loading previously
//! persisted data.
//!
//! IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS:\n
//! It's seemingly ridiculous to return the same stream over and over
//! again, but doing this enables the interface to be used in cases
//! where different streams are returned for each request.
//!
class API_EXPORT CSingleStreamSearcher : public core::CDataSearcher
{
    public:
        //! The \p stream must already be open when the constructor is
        //! called.
        CSingleStreamSearcher(const TIStreamP &stream);

        //! Get the stream to retrieve data from.
        //! \return Pointer to the input stream.
        //! Some errors cannot be detected by this call itself, and are
        //! indicated by the stream going into the "bad" state as it is
        //! read from.
        virtual TIStreamP search(size_t currentDocNum, size_t limit);

    private:
        //! The stream we're reading from.
        TIStreamP m_Stream;
