//! \brief
//! Parse XML input where each line is a separate XML document.
//!
//! DESCRIPTION:\n
//! Since newline characters within values can be represented as &#xA; in
//! XML, it is always possible to write a whole XML document to a single
//! line.  Doing this makes it easy to put many XML documents into a file
//! or data stream and easily tell where one ends and the next begins.
//!
//! This class is designed to parse such data.  Each line is expected to be
//! a complete single XML document that will be converted to a single event
//! for processing.
//!
//! IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS:\n
//! Takes an interface to the XML parser as a constructor argument to allow
//! performance comparisons between different XML parsers.
//!
class API_EXPORT CLineifiedXmlInputParser : public CLineifiedInputParser {
public:
    //! Construct with an XML parser interface and an input stream to be
    //! parsed.  Once a stream is passed to this constructor, no other
    //! object should read from it.  For example, if std::cin is passed, no
    //! other object should read from std::cin, otherwise unpredictable and
    //! incorrect results will be generated.

    //! Read records from the stream. The supplied reader function is called
    //! once per record.  If the supplied reader function returns false,
    //! reading will stop.  This method keeps reading until it reaches the
    //! end of the stream or an error occurs.  If it successfully reaches
    //! the end of the stream it returns true, otherwise it returns false.
