//! \brief
//! Enables a data adder to run in a different thread.
//!
//! DESCRIPTION:\n
//! A wrapper around core::CThread to hide the gory details of
//! running a data adder in the background.
//!
//! Only one background persistence may run at any time.  This
//! is partly to avoid clashes in whatever external data store
//! state is being persisted to, and partly because the chances
//! are that a lot of memory is being used by the temporary
//! copy of the data to be persisted.
//!
//! Persistence happens in a background thread and further
//! persistence requests via the startBackgroundPersist*() methods
//! will be rejected if the background thread is executing.
//! However, calls to startBackgroundPersist() and
//! startBackgroundPersistIfAppropriate() are not thread safe and
//! must not be made concurrently.
//!
//! IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS:\n
//! This class expects to call a persistence function taking
//! just the data adder as an argument.  It's easy to wrap up
//! extra data to be passed to a function that requires more by
//! using a std::bind.  std::bind copies its arguments, which
//! is generally what is required for access in a separate
//! thread.  However, note that a couple of copies are made, so
//! if the bound data is very large then binding a
//! std::shared_ptr may be more appropriate than binding
//! values.
//!
//! A data adder must be supplied to the constructor, and, since
//! this is held by reference it must outlive this object.  If
//! the data adder is not thread safe then it may not be used by
//! any other object until after this object is destroyed.
//!
