//! \brief
//! Pass output data to another CDataProcessor object
//!
//! DESCRIPTION:\n
//! Pass the output of one CDataProcessor object to another one.
//! This enables multiple processing steps to be performed within a
//! single Ml process, avoiding the overhead of converting to CSV
//! and back where Ml custom search commands would be adjacent in
//! a search pipe.
//!
//! IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS:\n
//! The function to be called for each output record is encapsulated
//! in a std::function to reduce coupling.
//!
