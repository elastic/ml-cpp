//! \brief
//! Base class to parse lines containing nested documents from a stream.
//!
//! DESCRIPTION:\n
//! This class can be used as a base for more complex parsers where each
//! line of a stream is guaranteed to represent exactly one document.
//!
//! IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS:\n
//! Does not use std::getline as it's not portably fast - see
//! http://info.prelert.com/blog/stdgetline-is-the-poor-relation
//!
//! The original use case was to factor out commonality from the
//! ND-JSON parser and (now deleted) newline delimited XML parser.
//!
class API_EXPORT CNdInputParser : public CInputParser {
public:
    //! Construct with an input stream to be parsed.  Once a stream is
    //! passed to this constructor, no other object should read from it.
    //! For example, if std::cin is passed, no other object should read from
    //! std::cin, otherwise unpredictable and incorrect results will be
    //! generated.
    CNdInputParser(std::istream& strmIn);

protected:
    //! Line end character
    static const char LINE_END;

    using TCharPSizePr = std::pair<char*, size_t>;

protected:
    //! Return a pointer to the start of the next line and its length,
    //! reading extra data from the stream if required.  The pair (NULL, 0)
    //! will be returned if no further data is available.  The newline
    //! character at the end of the line is replaced with a zero terminator
    //! byte so that the line can later be parsed in-situ by a library
    //! that expects a zero-terminated string.
    TCharPSizePr parseLine();

    //! Reset the work buffer to empty.  This should be called if the stream
    //! that data is being read from might have had its stream buffer
    //! changed.
    void resetBuffer();

private:
    //! Allocate this much memory for the working buffer
    static const size_t WORK_BUFFER_SIZE;

    //! Reference to the stream we're going to read from
    std::istream& m_StrmIn;

    using TScopedCharArray = boost::scoped_array<char>;

    //! The working buffer is a raw character array rather than a string to
    //! facilitate the use of std::istream::read() to obtain input rather
    //! than std::getline().  std::getline() is efficient in the GNU STL but
    //! sadly not in the Microsoft or Apache STLs, where it copies one
    //! character at a time.  std::istream::read() uses memcpy() to shuffle
    //! data around on all platforms, and is hence an order of magnitude
    //! faster.  (This is the sort of optimisation to be used ONLY after
    //! careful profiling in the rare cases where the reduction in code
    //! clarity yields a large performance benefit.)  The array of
    //! characters is NOT zero terminated, which is something to be aware of
    //! when accessing it.

    size_t m_WorkBufferCapacity;
    char* m_WorkBufferPtr;
    char* m_WorkBufferEnd;
