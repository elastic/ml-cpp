//! \brief
//! Write output data in CSV format
//!
//! DESCRIPTION:\n
//! Write output data in the CSV format (Excel style by default) either
//! to a stream or a string.
//!
//! The output format consists of:
//! 1) Field names
//! 2) Data rows
//!
//! The default separator (,) can be changed to any other character e.g. \t
//! which would make this a tab separated value output writer.
//!
//! IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS:\n
//! Using the Excel style CSV format by default.  So, by default:
//! - Fields are only quoted if they contain a quote, the separator or
//!   the record end character
//! - Quotes are escaped by doubling them up
//!
//! It is not acceptable to have the separator character be the same as the
//! escape character, the quote character or the record end character.
//!
