//! \brief
//! A streaming filter that maps persistence to restore format, specific to
//! ES requirements.
//!
//! DESCRIPTION:\n
//! The restore format differs from the persistence format as it is optimized
//! for bulk indexing into ES.
//! Persist format is:
//! { bulk metadata }
//! { document source }
//! '\0'
//!
//! Restore format is:
//! { Elasticsearch get response }
//! '\0'
//!
//! IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS:\n
//! Using boost::iostreams for a real streaming implementation to avoid large allocations.
//!
//! If the filter is applied on data in the restore format it does not change it.
//!
//! NOTE:\n
//! When using it with boost::iostreams::filtering_ostream note that the filters gets
//! copied once pushed to the ostream instance.
//!
