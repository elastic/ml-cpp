//! \brief Hierarchy for running a specific core::CDataFrame analyses.
//!
//! DESCRIPTION:\n
//! This hierarchy manages the running of specific analyses on a core::CDataFrame
//! object. It provides common interface for reporting progress and errors back to
//! calling code and starting an analysis.
//!
//! IMPLEMENTATION:\n
//! Particular analyses are specified by a JSON object which is passed as a header
//! to the data_frame_analyzer command before any data. It is the responsibility of
//! the CDataFrameAnalysisSpecification to parse this header although it passes off
//! the reading of the analysis parameters object to implementations of this runner.
//! Therefore CDataFrameAnalysisSpecification is also responsible for creating an
//! appropriate runner object for the data_frame_analyzer command. A particular
//! analysis is launched by the CDataFrameAnalysisSpecification::run method which
//! returns a reference to the appropriate CDataFrameAnalysisRunner implementation.
//!
//! This launches the work to do the analysis in a background thread so that the
//! main thread remains responsive and can periodically report progress and errors.
//!
//! No mechanism is provided to cancel the work (yet) because it is anticipated
//! that this will be probably be achieved by killing the process and it is too
//! early to determine how to implement a good cooperative interrupt scheme.
