//! \brief Manages setting of sample counts.
//!
//! DESCRIPTION:\n
//! To handle variable data rates we gather statistics on an almost
//! fixed number of measurements (since the distribution of these
//! statistics is a function of the measurement count). The correction
//! we apply to account for the varying measurement count in the
//! likelihood function is approximate and so if the mean bucket
//! bucket count wanders too far from the sample count we reset the
//! the sample count.
