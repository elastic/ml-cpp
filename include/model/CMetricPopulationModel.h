//! \brief The model for computing the anomalousness of the values
//! each person in a population generates in a data stream.
//!
//! DESCRIPTION:\n
//! This model computes the probability of the metric value a person
//! generates in the bucketing time interval given the typical values
//! all people generate in that interval for each person in a population.
//! There are two distinct types of probability that it can compute:
//! a probability on the current bucketing interval and a probability
//! based on all the person's interactions to date. The later uses
//! (statistical) models of the person's metric values, and is only
//! available if person models are created.
//!
//! Various features of the data can be modeled. These include the
//! minimum, maximum and mean of a set of attributes across.
//!
//! IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS:\n
//! The data about the current bucketing interval is stored on the model
//! so that the data gatherer objects can be shared by multiple models.
//! This is to reduce the model memory footprint when the event data is
//! being batched by time for comparison in which case all models for
//! the same attribute share a data gatherer.
//!
//! It assumes data are supplied in time order since this means minimal
//! state can be maintained.
