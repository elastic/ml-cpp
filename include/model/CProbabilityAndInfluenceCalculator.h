//! \brief Computes the overall probability and influences on a collection
//! of feature values and corresponding influencer field value feature
//! values.
//!
//! DESCRIPTION:\n
//! This implements the calculation of the aggregate probability of a
//! collection of feature values. Each feature value is supplied to the
//! addProbability function. In addition, for each feature value, a
//! collection of influencer field values, together with the corresponding
//! feature values for the restriction to the records labeled with each
//! influencer field value, can be added via addInfluencers. In this case
//! the influences on the value are found and this then updates the overall
//! influence probabilities. Ultimately, the overall, or aggregate, probability
//! and influences on this can be computed, after all probabilities and
//! influencer field values have been added, using the calculate function.
//!
//! IMPLEMENTATION:\n
//! This uses a plug-in pattern to support different influence calculations
//! which are selected at runtime. This is necessary because different features
//! use different influence calculations, but the features are selected based
//! on the commands the user runs.

//! \brief Interface for influence calculations.
//!
//! DESCRIPTION:\n
//! The influence calculation tries to determine the extent to which
//! an anomaly is affected by records labeled with a particular
//! influencing field value. What we'd ideally like to determine is
//! whether an anomaly is reasonably considered to be caused by the
//! values of the fields labeled by an influencing fields value. To
//! quantify this, we like to say that if none of the records in the
//! anomaly are labeled with an influencing field value then it has
//! no influence on the anomaly, i.e. its influence is 0. Conversely,
//! if all the records in the anomaly are labeled with the field
//! value it has complete influence, i.e. its influence is 1. All
//! other cases are an interpolation between these two cases.
//!
//! The exact form of the influence calculation depends on the way
//! the feature is extracted from the records. All calculations
//! proceed along the lines of asking either 1) "would there still
//! be an anomaly if only the records labeled with the field value
//! were present", or 2) "would there still be an anomaly if none
//! of the records labeled with the field value were present".
