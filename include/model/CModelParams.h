//! DESCIRIPTION:\n
//! The idea of this class is to encapsulate global model configuration
//! parameters to avoid the need of updating the constructor signatures
//! of all the classes in the CModel hierarchy when new parameters added.
//!
//! IMPLEMENTATION:\n
//! This is purposely not implemented as a nested class so that it can
//! be forward declared.
