//!
//! DESCRIPTION:\n
//! Because of our handling of the extended probability range for
//! joint probabilities it is not necessarily the case that the
//! node probabilities are the inverse of their anomaly scores
//! after aggregation. However, it is important that this is true
//! when we write them out for normalization to work as expected.
//! This visitor ensures this invariant holds in a bottom up
//! breadth first pass over the results.
