//! \brief The model for computing the anomalousness of the rate at which
//! each person in a population generates events in a data stream.
//!
//! DESCRIPTION:\n
//! This model computes the probability of the rate at which a person
//! generates events in the bucketing time interval given the typical
//! rates at which all people generate events in that interval for each
//! person in a population. There are two distinct types of probability
//! that it can compute: a probability on the current bucketing interval
//! and a probability based on all the person's interactions to date.
//! The later uses (statistical) models of the person's event rates for
//! each attribute for which they generate events, and is only available
//! if person models are created.
//!
//! Various other features of the data can be modeled. These include the
//! the rarity of each attribute across the population, which is defined,
//! informally, as the proportion of people which generate events for
//! that attribute, and the frequency with which a person generates events
//! in each attribute. These are both categorical data and this model
//! maintains multinomial distributions (across all attributes) for them.
//!
//! The rarity of attributes enters in to the probability calculation
//! by using a naive Bayes assumption that probability (function) of
//! each attribute count feature is conditionally independent on the
//! attribute. The model, approximately, computes the probability of
//! seeing a less likely set of attributes and counts for the person.
//! If the frequency with which a person generates events in an attribute
//! is modeled then the expectation of this probability is taken w.r.t.
//! the multinomial distribution describing the probability of a person
//! generating a given combination of attributes.
//!
//! IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS:\n
//! The data about the current bucketing interval is stored on the model
//! so that the data gatherer objects can be shared by multiple models.
//! This is to reduce the model memory footprint when the event data is
//! being batched by time to support comparison in which case all models
//! for the same attribute share a data gatherer.
//!
//! It assumes data are supplied in time order since this means minimal
//! state can be maintained.
