//! \brief Calculate prediction-based corrections for interim results.
//!
//! DESCRIPTION:\n
//! This is used to calculate corrections for interim results values so that
//! they are adjusted according to an estimation of how complete the bucket is.
//! This decreases the probability of false positives for functions that are
//! sensitive to the bucket completeness (e.g. count).
//!
//! IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS:\n
//! In order to estimate the bucket completeness the overall bucket count is
//! modelled and the completeness is calculated as the ratio of the current
//! bucket count against the expected one. This method was preferred compared
//! to a time-based calculation because it makes less assumptions about the
//! distribution of events over time. The bucket count is modelled via a time
//! series decomposition. While the decomposition is not initialiased, a mean
//! accumulator is used.
