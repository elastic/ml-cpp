//! \brief
//! Simply records and reports overall event counts
//!
//! DESCRIPTION:\n
//! Given a stream of events, record and report the number observed
//! in each time bucket.
//!
//! The output of this class is used to plot event rate charts
//! and removes the burden of maintaining accurate overall event
//! counts from the real anomaly detector  classes.
//!
//! IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS:\n
//! Events must be received in increasing time order.
//!
//! This class sits within the CAnomalyDetector hierarchy even
//! though it doesn't detect anomalies, because its output goes
//! passes through the same data path as the output of the real
//! anomaly detector classes.
