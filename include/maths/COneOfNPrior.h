//! \brief Interface for a prior distribution which assumes data are from one
//! of N models.
//!
//! DESCRIPTION:\n
//! Implements a prior distribution which assumes all data is from one of N
//! models (subsequently referred to as component models).
//!
//! Each component model is assumed to have a prior which implements the CPrior
//! interface. An object of this class thus comprises the individual component
//! prior objects plus a collection of weights, one per component model (see
//! addSamples for details). Each weight is the probability that the sampled
//! data comes from the corresponding component models.
//!
//! IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS:\n
//! This is basically an implementation of the composite pattern for CPrior
//! in a meaningful sense for the hierarchy. It holds component models by
//! pointer to the base class so that any prior in the hierarchy can be mixed
//! in. All component models are owned by the object (it wouldn't make sense
//! to share them) so this also defines the necessary functions to support
//! value semantics and manage the heap.
