//! \brief Interface for a conjugate prior distribution for a Poisson variable.
//!
//! DESCRIPTION:\n
//! Our Poisson variable is described by \f$Y - u\f$, where \f$Y\f$ is a Poisson
//! R.V. with unknown rate.
//!
//! If u is positive then the samples can be negative. The parameters of \f$Y\f$
//! are modeled by a gamma distribution, which is the conjugate prior for a
//! Poisson with unknown rate.
//!
//! All prior distributions implement a process whereby they relax back to the
//! non-informative over some period without update (see propagateForwardsByTime).
//! The rate at which they relax is controlled by the decay factor supplied to the
//! constructor.
//!
//! IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS:\n
//! All priors are derived from CPrior which defines the contract that is used
//! by composite priors. This allows us to select the most appropriate model for
//! the data when using one-of-n composition (see COneOfNPrior) or model data with
//! multiple modes when using multi-modal composition (see CMultimodalPrior).
//! From a design point of view this is the composite pattern.
