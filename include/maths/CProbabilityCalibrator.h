//! DESCRIPTION:\n
//! Calibrates a collection of probabilities s.t. they are close
//! to the historical empirical distribution of probabilities,
// i.e. we expect to see a probability of \f$p <= f\f$ approximately
//! \f$f * n\f$ given \f$n\f$ historical probabilities.

    //!   -# Partial - only increase probabilities using the
    //!      historical fractions less the cutoff. Don't use
    //!      the fractions smaller than the cutoff instead
    //!      scale probabilities so the transform is continuous.
    //!   -# Full - perform a full calibration to historical
    //!      fractions.
