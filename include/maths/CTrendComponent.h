//! \brief Models the trend component of a time series.
//!
//! DESCRIPTION:\n
//! This is an ensemble of trend models fitted over different time scales.
//! In particular, we age data at different rates from each of the models.
//! A prediction is then a weighted average of the different models. We
//! adjust the weighting of components based on the difference in their
//! decay rate and the target decay rate.
//!
//! The key advantage of this approach is that we can also adjust the
//! weighting over a forecast based on how far ahead we are predicting.
//! This means at each time scale we can revert to the trend for that time
//! scale. It also allows us to accurately estimate confidence intervals
//! (since these can be estimated from the variation of observed values
//! we see w.r.t. the predictions from the next longer time scale component).
//! This produces plausible looking and this sort of mean reversion is common
//! in many real world time series.
