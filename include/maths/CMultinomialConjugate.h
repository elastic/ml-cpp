//! \brief A conjugate prior distribution for a multinomial variable.
//!
//! DESCRIPTION:\n
//! The probabilities are modeled by a Dirichlet prior (which is the conjugate
//! prior for a multinomial distribution). This prior has a fixed maximum number
//! of categories, supplied to the constructor, and monitors the number of values
//! in a hold all category once it has "overflowed". In this case, the upper and
//! lower bounds for the probability of less likely samples will be different.
//!
//! All prior distributions implement a process whereby they relax back to the
//! non-informative over some period without update (see propagateForwardsByTime).
//! The rate at which they relax is controlled by the decay factor supplied to the
//! constructor.
//!
//! IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS:\n
//! All priors are derived from CPrior which defines the contract that is used
//! by composite priors. This allows us to select the most appropriate model for
//! the data when using one-of-n composition (see COneOfNPrior) or model data with
//! multiple modes when using multi-modal composition (see CMultimodalPrior).
//! From a design point of view this is the composite pattern.
