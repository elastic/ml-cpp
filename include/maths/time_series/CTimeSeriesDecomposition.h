//! \brief Decomposes a time series into a linear combination of trend and cyclical
//! functions and a stationary random process.
//!
//! DESCRIPTION:\n
//! This looks for a trend and daily, weekly, weekend/weekday, and yearly seasonality.
//! It also checks for offsets with high autocorrelation and predictive calendar
//! components, such as day of month, last Friday of month, etc. It maintains the
//! state to do this in a streaming fashion and will both add and remove predictive
//! features as they come and go from the time series.
//!
//! It uses an additive combination of the predictive features it has selected to
//! predict both the values and residual variance w.r.t. these predictions. It uses
//! exponential decay to remove old data from the component models. The schedule is
//! different for each component and the overall rate is controlled by the decay
//! rate.
//!
//! The main functionality it provides are to predict the value and variance at
//! a specified time, value and scale, to remove its prediction from a sample of
//! the time series, see detrend, and forecasting, see forecast.
