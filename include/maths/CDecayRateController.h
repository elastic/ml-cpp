//! \brief Manages the decay rate based on the data characteristics.
//!
//! DESCRIPTION:\n
//! We can use estimates of the prediction errors to understand if our
//! models are capturing the time varying components of a time series
//! and if there has recently been a significant change from the time
//! series behavior. In particular, we look at
//!   -# The ratio of the prediction bias to the prediction error.
//!   -# The ratio of the recent absolute to the long term prediction
//!      error.
//!
//! If there is a significant bias in our predictions then our model is
//! failing to capture some time varying component of the time series
//! and the best we can do is to remember less history. If the short term
//! and prediction error is large compared to the long term prediction
//! error then the system has recently undergone some state change and
//! we should re-learn the model parameters as fast as possible.
