//! \brief Interface for a multivariate prior distribution which assumes data
//! are from one of N models.
//!
//! DESCRIPTION:\n
//! Implements a prior distribution which assumes all data is from one of N
//! models (subsequently referred to as component models).
//!
//! Each component model is assumed to have a prior which implements the
//! CMultivariatePrior interface. An object of this class thus comprises the
//! individual component prior objects plus a collection of weights, one per
//! component model (see addSamples for details). Each weight is proportional
//! to the probability that the sampled data comes from the corresponding
//! component models.
//!
//! IMPORTANT: Other than for testing, this class should not be constructed
//! directly. Creation of objects is managed by CMultivariateOneOfNPriorFactory.
//!
//! IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS:\n
//! This is basically an implementation of the composite pattern for
//! CMultivariatePrior in a meaningful sense for the hierarchy. It holds
//! component models by pointer to the base class so that any prior in the
//! hierarchy can be mixed in. All component models are owned by the object
//! (it wouldn't make sense to share them) so this also defines the necessary
//! functions to support value semantics and manage the heap.
