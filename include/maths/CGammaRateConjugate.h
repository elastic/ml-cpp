//! \brief A conjugate prior distribution for a stationary gamma variable.
//!
//! DESCRIPTION:\n
//! Our gamma variable is described by \f$Y - u\f$, where \f$Y\f$ is a gamma
//! R.V. with unknown shape and rate and \f$u\f$ is a fixed constant offset.
//!
//! If \f$u\f$ is positive then the samples can be negative. The rate of
//! \f$Y\f$ is modeled as a gamma distribution (which is the conjugate prior
//! for a gamma with known shape and unknown rate) and the shape of \f$Y\f$
//! is estimated by maximum likelihood. In particular, the shape is estimated
//! by maximizing the marginal likelihood function obtained by integrating
//! over the prior for the rate.
//!
//! Note that although a joint conjugate prior exists for a gamma with unknown
//! shape and rate, even the normalization factor requires numerical integration,
//! so it isn't really suitable for our purposes.
//!
//! All prior distributions implement a process whereby they relax back to the
//! non-informative over some period without update (see propagateForwardsByTime).
//! The rate at which they relax is controlled by the decay factor supplied to the
//! constructor.
//!
//! IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS:\n
//! All priors are derived from CPrior which defines the contract that is used
//! by composite priors. This allows us to select the most appropriate model for
//! the data when using one-of-n composition (see COneOfNPrior) or model data with
//! multiple modes when using multi-modal composition (see CMultimodalPrior).
//! From a design point of view this is the composite pattern.
