//! \brief A minimal fixed size thread pool for implementing CThreadPoolExecutor.
//!
//! IMPLEMENTATION:\n
//! This purposely has very limited interface and is intended to mainly support
//! CThreadPoolExecutor. This provides the mechanism by which we expose the thread
//! pool to the rest of the code via calls core::async.
class CORE_EXPORT CStaticThreadPool {
public:
    using TTask = std::packaged_task<boost::any()>;

    CStaticThreadPool& operator=(CStaticThreadPool&&) = delete;

    //! Schedule a Callable type to be executed by a thread in the pool.
    //!
    //! \note This forwards the task to the queue.
    //! \note This can block (if the task queues are full). This is intentional
    //! and is suitable for our use case where we don't need to guaranty that this
    //! always returns immediately and instead want to exert back pressure on the
    //! thread scheduling tasks if the pool can't keep up.
