//! DESCRIPTION:\n
//! Portable wrapper for the uname() function.
//!
//! IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS:\n
//! This has been broken into a class of its own because Windows does
//! not implement Unix's uname() function.
//!
//! Each member of the utsname struct should be implemented as a
//! separate method, as usually only one is required.

    //! underlying Windows NT version.
