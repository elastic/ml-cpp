//! \brief
//! A cache of strings that can be reused
//!
//! DESCRIPTION:\n
//! Rather than repeatedly construct strings from char
//! pointers, there are occasions where it may be preferable
//! to reuse an existing string object with the same contents
//! as the char pointer is pointing to.  Looking up an
//! existing string and returning a reference to it avoids
//! calls to malloc() and free(), which are expensive and
//! cause contention between threads.
//!
//! This approach is very beneficial on platforms where the
//! STL string class uses a copy-on-write implementation.  On
//! other platforms it will probably WORSEN performance, so
//! ideally the calling code should check at runtime what the
//! situation is and bypass this class for platforms that
//! don't have copy-on-write strings.
//!
//! This class should only be used where a small number of
//! strings are expected to be seen repeatedly.  If many
//! strings are different, this class will be a liability
//! rather than a benefit.
//!
//! IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS:\n
//! Using a hash set for the cache of strings.
//!
//! It is absolutely crucial that no temporary strings are
//! created when looking up a string that is already in the
//! cache - doing so would completely defeat the purpose of
//! this class!
//!
//! This class is not thread safe - it is up to the caller
//! to ensure each instance of this class is only used from
//! within a single thread.
//!
//! Boost's hash function applied to an empty string returns
//! a non-zero hash, which would be hard to reproduce for a
//! range of characters, hence we use our own hash algorithm.
//!
