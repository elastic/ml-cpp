//! \brief
//! Can be used for timing within a program
//!
//! DESCRIPTION:\n
//! Can be used for timing within a program when intervals must be
//! measured more accurately than to the nearest second.
//!
//! IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS:\n
//! The interface mirrors the stop watch functionality you would expect
//! on a cheap digital watch.
//!
//! A 64 bit counter is used to store the elapsed milliseconds, because
//! 2^32 milliseconds is less than 50 days, and, in production, our
//! processes should be able to run for longer than this.
//!
