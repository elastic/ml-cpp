//! \brief
//! Spawn detached processes.
//!
//! DESCRIPTION:\n
//! Spawns processes that do not need to communicate with the parent
//! process once they're running.  (If you need to spawn processes
//! that communicate with the parent process, look at the core::CPOpen
//! class.)
//!
//! A list of permitted processes must be supplied to the constructor.
//! Requests to start processes not on this list will fail.
//!
//! On Windows, only .exe files may be spawned.
//!
//! Can also kill processes that it started.
//!
//! IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS:\n
//! Closes parent process file descriptors in the spawned children.
//!
//! There are a couple of limitations with the way this is done on *nix:
//! 1) File descriptors above a million are not closed - the assumption
//!    is that the process running this code will not run with such a high
//!    ulimit, or that if it is such high numbered files will not be open
//!    at the time it is started and that the process itself will not have
//!    opened them.
//! 2) It is assumed that no files will be opened or closed within the
//!    process running this code while the spawn() method of this class is
//!    running.  In reality, this means that this class cannot be used in
//!    an arbitrary multi-threaded process.  It can only be used in a
//!    process dedicated to spawning processes and where this restriction
//!    can be managed.
//!
//! To enforce the constraint that only processes started by this class
//! can be killed, a lookup of all the spawned process IDs is kept, and
//! a thread tracks deaths of spawned processes to keep this lookup
//! up-to-date.  (If we simply kept track of spawned process IDs but
//! didn't adjust for deaths of processes that exited without being
//! killed by this class then after a few days there'd be many obsolete
//! entires in the lookup, and this could represent a security risk
//! given how operating systems recycle process IDs.)
