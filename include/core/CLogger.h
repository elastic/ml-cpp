//! \brief
//! Core logging class in ML.
//!
//! DESCRIPTION:\n
//! Core logging class in ML.  Access to the actual logging
//! commands should be through macros.
//!
//! Errors that mean something has gone wrong, but the application
//! will continue to run, possibly losing a small amount of data or
//! with slightly inferior results, should be logged with the
//! LOG_ERROR macro.
//!
//! Errors that mean an application is not going to work at all
//! and will soon exit should be logged with the LOG_FATAL macro.
//! The LOG_FATAL macro itself does not change the program flow in
//! any way, so other code must still be written to effect the
//! shutdown of the application.
//!
//! The LOG_ABORT macro should only be used in situations that
//! would NEVER occur if our code were free of bugs.  Do NOT use
//! LOG_ABORT for situations such as invalid config files, unexpected
//! data received on a socket, or other things that might happen
//! at a customer site.  Effectively, a LOG_ABORT is a fancy version
//! of assert().
//!
//! IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS:\n
//! Wrapper around Boost.Log.
//!
//! Singleton for simplicity.
//!
//! By default, logging is to stderr.  However, it's possible to
//! tell the logger to reinitialise itself using a properties file.
//! The vast majority of ML processes that we ship will
//! log to a named pipe that's being read from by the Elasticsearch
//! JVM.
//!
//! The TRACE level of logging should never be enabled in shipped
//! product, but can be useful when a unit test needs to log more
//! detailed information.
//!
