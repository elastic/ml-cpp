//! \brief
//! Swap the order of bytes in a variable.
//!
//! DESCRIPTION:\n
//! Class to convert between big endian and little endian
//! representations of values.  Usually this would be done
//! with functions like ntohs() or htonl(), but there may
//! be times when we want to convert endianness regardless
//! of the network and host orders, e.g. when reading a
//! file from another system.
//!
//! IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS:\n
//! This has the potential to trash memory, e.g. a complex
//! class with multiple data members and/or a vtable.  It's up
//! to the caller to ensure it's only called for types where
//! it's sensible, e.g. builtin numeric types.
//!
