//! \brief
//! Class to extract "words" from a string.
//!
//! DESCRIPTION:\n
//! Class to extract words from a string.
//!
//! Words are taken to be sub-strings of 1 or more letters, all lower case
//! except possibly the first, preceded by a space, and followed by 0 or 1
//! punctuation characters and then a space (or the end of the string).
//! Additionally, words must be in the dictionary.  (This implies we'll
//! need to get foreign dictionaries if we get customers using the product
//! in languages other than English.)
//!
//! There is also an option to only accept words when a specified number
//! of words occur consecutively in the string.
//!
//! IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS:\n
//! Words are returned in a single string.  In future it might be worth
//! adding the option to return them in a vector.
//!
