//! \brief
//! A wrapper around a shared output stream for concurrent writes, handling
//! writes.
//!
//! DESCRIPTION:\n
//! Takes an output stream and wraps it, provides buffers and pooling.
//!
//! Consider not to use this directly but CRapidJsonConcurrentLineWriter.
//!
//! IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS:\n
//! Pool and buffer sizes are hardcoded.

    //! Upper boundary for buffer size, if above buffer gets automatically shrunk
    //! back to BUFFER_START_SIZE after last usage.
