//! \brief
//! A means to have multiple threads work on some input
//!
//! DESCRIPTION:\n
//! Before the thread farm is started, one or more processors must be added to
//! it.  Then, when each message is added to the running thread farm, a copy of
//! it is passed to each of the processors via their own separate message
//! queues.  The processors then do some work (presumably different for each
//! processor otherwise there's no point), and pass the results back to the
//! thread farm which in turn passes all the results to a handler as soon as
//! it gets them.
//!
//! IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS:\n
//! The type used for messages should be cheap to copy.
//! The handler must have a processResult() method.
//! Each processor must have a msgToResult() method.
//! The message type must have a copy constructor.
//! The result type must have both a default constructor and a copy constructor.
//!
