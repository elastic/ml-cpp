//! \brief A set that allows efficient lookups of strings.
//!
//! DESCRIPTION:\n
//! Users can define filters to be used in conjunction with rules.
//! This class models those filters as a set and allows efficient lookups.
//! The supported filter items are:
//!   - Full patterns: "foo" will match "foo" only
//!   - Prefix patterns: "foo*" will match "foo" and "foo_"
//!   - Suffix patterns: "*foo" will match "foo" and "_foo"
//!   - Contains patterns: "*foo*" will match "foo" and "_foo_"
//!
//! IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS:\n
//! Upon building the set, patterns are categorised in the aforementioned 4
//! categories. They are then stored in a corresponding prefix tree that allows
//! efficient lookups. In particular a key is contained in the set if:
//!   - its start matches a prefix pattern
//!   - its end matched a suffix pattern
//!   - it matches fully against a full pattern
//!   - the start of any of its substrings ending at its end matches a contains pattern
