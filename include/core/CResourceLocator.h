//! \brief
//! Class to find the appropriate directories for various things.
//!
//! DESCRIPTION:\n
//! Look for various directories in a way that doesn't rely on any
//! environment variables in production.
//!
//! IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS:\n
//! Directories are looked for either relative to the location of the
//! program that's asking, or relative to $CPP_SRC_HOME.  The latter
//! is for the benefit of developers working on their own machines.
//!
//! Does NOT cache the directories.  Some are quite expensive to compute,
//! so the methods should not be called repeatedly.  It is assumed that
//! the classes using this class will do their own caching if required.
//!
