//! \brief
//! A CDataAdder-derived class that compresses and chunks data
//!
//! DESCRIPTION:\n
//! A CDataAdder-derived class that compresses and chunks data
//! suitable for decompressing by CStateDecompressor.
//! This class implements the CDataAdder interface, and
//! is initialised with a CDataAdder object that contains
//! the underlying data store - so this class basically fits on top
//! of an existing CDataAdder (and it's counterpart CStateDecompressor
//! on top of a CDataSearcher) to enable compression for the
//! ml persist interface
//!
//! IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS:\n
//! Not copyable.
//! Uses boost filtering_stream internally, and has a
//! dependency on the CBase64Filter class, as it is expected
//! that downstream CDataAdder/CDataSearcher store will
//! support strings of Base64 encoded data
//!
