//! \brief
//! RAII file deleter
//!
//! DESCRIPTION:\n
//! On destruction an object of this class will attempt
//! to delete the file whose name was specified to its
//! constructor.
//!
//! IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS:\n
//! Only a "best effort" is made to remove the specified
//! file.  In particular, on Windows it will not be removed
//! if it is still open.
//!
//! This class does NOT currently attempt to close the file
//! before removing it.  In future it could be extended
//! to take a file descriptor/FILE pointer/stream reference
//! and close this before attempting to delete the file.
//!
