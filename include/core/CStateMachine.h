//! \brief A simple state machine implementation.
//!
//! DESCRIPTION:\n
//! This defines an alphabet of symbols, a set of states and a transition
//! table.
//!
//! A state machine is the tuple \f$\left(\Sigma, S, \delta, s_0\right)\f$.
//! Here,
//!   -# \f$\Sigma\f$ is an alphabet of symbols which are passed to the
//!      machine.
//!   -# \f$S\f$ are the collection of state.
//!   -# \f$\delta\f$ is the transition function \f$\delta : S \cross \Sigma \leftarrow S\f$.
//!   -# \f$s_0\f$ Is the initial state.
//!
//! IMPLEMENTATION:\n
//! Most of the state is stored statically and unique machines are identified
//! by their alphabet, states, and transition table. This state can be shared
//! by many instances of the machine and so the only state that needs to be
//! stored is the machine identifier, which is managed by the create function,
//! and the current state.
//!
//! Note I purposely haven't bothered to allow the user to register actions to
//! perform when a symbol is applied. This is because these typically need
//! additional information to be supplied and there is no way of doing that
//! at the level of this interface without using void* or equivalent. Instead
//! it is intended that the user of this class holds an instance of the state
//! machine and uses it to implement an apply function which receives additional
//! state.
//!
//! This implementation is mostly lock free since after it is created the shared
//! state of a machine is effectively constant and we can use the double locking
//! pattern in create with an atomic to pass a message to other threads that a
//! new machine is ready to use.
//!
//! \warning Currently this class is NOT thread safe.  The unlocked accesses
//! to ms_Machines can occur at the same time as ms_Machines is being expanded
//! leading to segmentation faults as the accessors traverse the deque data
//! structure while it's being changed.  Do not use this class in multithreaded
//! code until this is fixed.  The bug reference is:
//! https://github.com/elastic/machine-learning-cpp/issues/10

    //! \brief A custom paired down std::deque like container.
    //!
    //! DESCRIPTION:\n
    //! We have rather specific requirements for this container:
    //!   -# It must be (as) random access (as possible),
    //!   -# It must be possible for push_back to occur concurrently with
    //!      lookup of an existing item in the container.
    //!
    //! IMPLEMENTATION:\n
    //! With std::deque implementations any invocation of operator[] can
    //! fail if there is a concurrent push_back. The code using this class
    //! ensures that it only ever asks for an element which already exists
    //! in the container at the start of push_back. This is possible safely
    //! with a std::list. However, since this also needs to be random access,
    //! using a vanilla std::list, which has \f$O(N)\f$ complexity for
    //! accessing the \f$N^{th}\f$ item and poor locality of reference,
    //! is not suitable. Instead we prefer to use a list of preallocated
    //! std::vectors, on which it is also safe to call push_back, for our
    //! use case, provided doing so doesn't cause them to reallocate.
