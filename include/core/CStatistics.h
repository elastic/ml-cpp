//! DESCRIPTION:\n
//! A static collection of runtime global statistics and counters, atomically incremented
//!
//! To add a new stat, put it into the stat_t::EStatTypes enum, and add its details and
//! description to the ostream<< operator function in the implementation file
//!
//! IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS:\n
//! A singleton class: there should only be one collection of global stats
//!
