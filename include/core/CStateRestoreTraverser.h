//! \brief
//! Abstract interface for restoring state.
//!
//! DESCRIPTION:\n
//! Classes that need to restore state may accept this interface
//! as a means to retrieve values being restored without needing
//! to know the exact format that they were stored in.
//!
//! IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS:\n
//! Not copyable.
//!
//! This class has been named "traverser" rather than "iterator" as
//! it works on a two dimensional structure: as well as iterating
//! forwards it's possible to descend to sub-levels of the current
//! element and iterate through the values at that level.  Since
//! each level would have its own "end" iterator, the interface is
//! that the next() method returns false when the end of a particular
//! sub-level is reached.
//!
//! All values are returned as strings.
//!

    public:
        CStateRestoreTraverser(void);

        //! Virtual destructor for abstract class
        virtual ~CStateRestoreTraverser(void);

        //! Navigate to the next element at the current level, or return false
        //! if there isn't one
        virtual bool next(void) = 0;

        //! Does the current element have a sub-level?
        virtual bool hasSubLevel(void) const = 0;

        //! Traverse the sub-level of the current element.  The supplied
        //! function will be called with the traverser pointing at the first
        //! element of the sub-level.  When the function returns, the traverser
        //! will ascend back to the element at the higher level.  The supplied
        //! should return a bool and this will be passed on as the return value
        //! of this method.
