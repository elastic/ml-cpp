//! \brief
//! Class to create named pipes.
//!
//! DESCRIPTION:\n
//! Creates and opens a named pipe for reading or writing, and returns
//! either a C++ stream or C FILE connected to that named pipe.
//!
//! IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS:\n
//! Although anonymous pipes are portable between Windows
//! and Unix, named pipes are not.  This class encapsulates
//! the platform specific code.  Note that it's only the
//! server side of the named pipe that requires this class -
//! the client side can use standard file functions.
//!
//! Windows named pipes always have names of the form:
//!
//! \\.\pipe\mypipename
//!
//! Unix named pipes can go in any writable directory of the
//! file system.
//!
//! Returned streams/FILEs are for binary data; Windows CRLF
//! translation is not applied.
//!
//! This class only allows named pipes to be created for either
//! reading or writing, not both.  Some platforms support
//! bi-directional named pipes, but the level of complexity
//! involved in getting a portable interface would be too high.
//! For bi-directional communications, the best thing is simply
//! to open two named pipes, one for reading and another for
//! writing.  These should be handled in separate threads on
//! at least one side of the connection, to avoid a deadlock
//! due to buffers filling up.
//!
