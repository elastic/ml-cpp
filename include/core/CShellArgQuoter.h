//! \brief
//! Quote a shell argument.
//!
//! DESCRIPTION:\n
//! Quote a shell argument, escaping any special characters within
//! the argument as necessary.
//!
//! IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS:\n
//! Arguments are escaped such that variable expansion does NOT
//! take place within them.  For example, if the argument is
//! $ES_HOME, then it will be escaped such that the program
//! the argument is being passed to receives literally $ES_HOME
//! and not the directory path that the environment variable
//! expands to.
