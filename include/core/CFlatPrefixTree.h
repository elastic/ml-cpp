//! \brief A flat prefix tree that allows efficient string lookups
//!
//! DESCRIPTION:\n
//! A trie tree that is packed in a vector. It allows for efficient
//! full or prefix string lookups. Incremental updates are not supported.
//! Updating the tree requires rebuilding it.
//!
//! IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS:\n
//! Trie trees allow for efficient string partial or full lookups.
//! They usually are implemented using pointers. The downside of that
//! approach is the lack of spatial locality resulting to low performance
//! due to cache misses. The CFlatPrefixTree works around this issue
//! by packing the trie in a vector. Each vector item is a node containing
//! a char, the type (leaf (l), branch (b) or both (*)) and the index of the node at
//! the next tree level. The vector contains two types of nodes:
//!   1) padding node: uses the char '$' and the next field is the
//!   number of distinct characters that are contained at a tree level.
//!   2) char node: contains the distinct character that is present at
//!   a tree level, its type and the index of the next tree level.
//! A tree level is better understood as the sum of the padding node and
//! the associated char nodes. For the input of (ab, abd, bdf)
//! the vector would look like:
//! [($, $, 2) (a, b, 3) (b, b, 7) ($, $, 1) (b, *, 5) ($, $, 1) (d, l, -) ($, $, 1) (d, b, 9) ($, $, 1) (f, l, -) ]
//! where '-' means no child and is actually represented by max(uint32_t).
//! This representation allows for search by visiting the first node, applying
//! binary search on the first character, moving on to the node indicated by
//! the characters next index, applying binary search on the second character,
//! and so on.
