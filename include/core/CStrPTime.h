//! \brief
//! Parse the date/time string in the buffer buf, according to the
//! string pointed to by format.
//!
//! DESCRIPTION:\n
//! Parse the date/time string in the buffer buf, according to the
//! string pointed to by format, and fill in the elements of the structure
//! pointed to by tm.  The resulting values will be relative to the local
//! time zone.
//!
//! See strptime man page for details.
//!
//! IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS:\n
//! This has been broken into a class of its own because the strptime()
//! functions on Linux don't support the %z format, which is required
//! to parse localhost_access_log files.
//!
//! Also, strptime() on Linux is supposed to skip over a timezone name
//! indicated by the %Z format, but (at least on Fedora 9) it doesn't.
//! So Linux requires special handling for %Z too.
//!
