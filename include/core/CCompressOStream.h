//! \brief
//! An output stream that writes to a boost filtering_stream endpoint.
//!
//! DESCRIPTION:\n
//! An extension of the C++ streams library that uploads data
//! that is written to the stream to a supplied boost::iostreams::
//! filtering_stream.
//!
//! IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS:\n
//! The upload is done in a separate thread to avoid blocking
//! the thread that creates the stream object.  A CDualThreadStreamBuf
//! manages the buffering of data between the client thread and
//! the upload thread.
