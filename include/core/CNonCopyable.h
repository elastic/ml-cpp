//! \brief
//! Equivalent to boost::noncopyable.
//!
//! DESCRIPTION:\n
//! This class is designed to be used wherever boost::noncopyable would
//! be used.  It has the advantage over boost::noncopyable that it does
//! not trigger Visual C++ warning C4275.
//!
//! Classes for which copying is not allowed should inherit privately
//! from this class.
//!
//! IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS:\n
//! The class is exported from the DLL, which means that non-inlined
//! versions of its methods will be generated even though they're all
//! inlined.  This is the difference compared to boost::noncopyable,
//! and what prevents Visual C++ warning C4275.
//!
