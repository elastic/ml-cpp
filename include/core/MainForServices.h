//! DESCRIPTION:\n
//! Boilerplate implentation of the main() function for applications
//! that may need to be run as a Windows service.
//!
//! Such programs MUST implement a mlMain() function instead of
//! a main() function in there Main.cc file, and include this header
//! in Main.cc only.
//!
//! IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS:\n
//! Although slightly unorthodox, factoring out the main() function
//! for Windows services into a single header avoids duplication into
//! every single application that may need to be run as a Windows
//! service.
//!
//! Despite being in the core library include directory, this file
//! should never be included in a library.
