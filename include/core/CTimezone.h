//! \brief
//! Portability wrapper to set the current time zone
//!
//! DESCRIPTION:\n
//! Portability wrapper to set the current time zone.  The Windows C runtime
//! library is not good at handling timezones other than the one that
//! Windows itself is set to, hence the need to wrap timezone related C
//! library calls.
//!
//! IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS:\n
//! Implemented as a Meyers singleton.
//!
//! On Unix, we use the standard timezone definitions in /usr/share/zoneinfo.
//! This is all handled automatically by the C runtime library.
//!
//! On Windows, calls that need timezone information, such as strftime(),
//! strptime() and localtime() are wrapped and instead use Boost to
//! translate UTC to local times.  This means that on Windows we're reliant
//! on a CSV file that comes with Boost to contain the correct timezone
//! information for every timezone that a customer might use.  (The Visual
//! C++ runtime library's ability to switch timezones is unbelivably poor -
//! daylight saving start/end dates are hardcoded to those in use in the USA
//! between 1986 and 2007 if you switch away from the operating system
//! timezone!)
//!
//! The reason we don't use Boost on all platforms is that Boost's knowledge
//! of daylight saving rules is inferior to that of Unix.  Boost only has one
//! set of rules per timezone, whereas Unix knows that, for example, the
//! daylight saving rules in the USA changed in 2007, so knows that if we're
//! parsing a file from 2006 then different rules apply.
//!
//! As a result, our implementation is imperfect for parsing historical data
//! on Windows.  Problems resulting from this are likely to be rare though.
//!
