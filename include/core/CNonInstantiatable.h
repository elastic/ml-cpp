//! \brief
//! Similar idea to boost::noncopyable, but for instantiation.
//!
//! DESCRIPTION:\n
//! Classes for which instantiation is not allowed, i.e. those that
//! have only static methods, should inherit privately from this
//! class.
//!
//! IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS:\n
//! The class is (seemingly pointlessly) exported from the DLL to
//! prevent Visual C++ warning C4275.
//!

        //! Prevent instantiation
        CNonInstantiatable(void);
        CNonInstantiatable(const CNonInstantiatable &);
