//! \brief
//! Class to check whether words are present in a dictionary.
//!
//! DESCRIPTION:\n
//! Class to check whether words are present in a dictionary.
//!
//! Can also be used to check which part of speech each word
//! represents, for example is it a noun, verb, etc.
//!
//! IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS:\n
//! Currently this only uses an English dictionary, albeit one with
//! US, UK and Canadian spelling variants.
//!
//! The English word list originated from SCOWL:
//! See http://sourceforge.net/projects/wordlist/files/SCOWL/
//!
//! This was then cross referenced with Moby Part-of-Speech to add
//! the part-of-speech codes:
//! See http://icon.shef.ac.uk/Moby/mpos.html
//!
//! All checks are case-insensitive.
//!
//! TODO - extend this to cope with different dictionaries for
//! different languages.
//!
//! Implemented as a Meyers singleton, but with a static pointer
//! too to avoid repeated locking in the instance() method (see
//! Modern C++ Design by Andrei Alexandrescu for details).
//!

public:

    //! The values used are deliberately powers of two so that in the
    //! future we could potentially bitwise-or them together for words
    //! with multiple uses.
