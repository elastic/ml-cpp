//! \brief
//! Functions to output unique_ptr and nullptr_t.
//!
//! DESCRIPTION:\n
//! Boost.Test likes to print values that fail assertions.  It
//! can do this when operator<< is defined for the type being
//! asserted on.  It is common that we assert on pointer values,
//! yet there is no operator<< for unique_ptr until C++20 and
//! no operator<< for nullptr until C++17.  This file adds
//! replacements for these until such time as we are using a
//! sufficiently modern standard.
//!
//! IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS:\n
//! Memory addresses are printed, not the dereferenced object.
//! The intermediate boost_test_print_type function is
//! overloaded rather than operator<< itself, as it will not
//! cause an overloading ambiguity as newer compiler versions
//! add the operators as extensions to the standard (for example
//! Xcode 10.3 has added operator<< for unique_ptr even when the
//! selected standard is C++14).  Functions need to be in the
//! std namespace so that they can be found via argument-dependent
//! lookup (since unique_ptr and nullptr_t are in the std
//! namespace).  This is not ideal but the intention is that this
//! file is a temporary measure.
//!
