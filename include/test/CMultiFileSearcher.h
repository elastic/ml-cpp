//! \brief
//! Retrieves data previously persisted to file.
//!
//! DESCRIPTION:\n
//! Implements the CDataSearcher interface for loading previously
//! persisted data.
//!
//! IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS:\n
//! Failure to open a file stream is not considered an error by this
//! class - it is left to the caller to decide whether it is a problem.
//!
//! This class is designed to reload data persisted by the CMultiFileDataAdder
//! class.  For data persisted by the CSingleStreamDataAdder class, use the
//! CSingleStreamSearcher.
//!
