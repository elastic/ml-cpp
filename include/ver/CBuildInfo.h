//! \brief
//! Wrapper for version/build numbers
//!
//! DESCRIPTION:\n
//! Wrapper for version/build numbers
//!
//! Only use this class from within a program's own code, NEVER from within
//! a library.
//!
//! IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS:\n
//! The implementation file for this class is generated on the fly at build time
//! by the Makefile from a template.  There are two possible templates:
//! - One for developers' individual builds
//! - One for full builds that could be given to a customer
//! Placeholders within these templates are substituted with the exact version
//! number, build number, build year and developer's name.
//!
//! The version library is a static library that is linked to each Ml
//! program.  It must never be linked into a shared library.  This rule means
//! that it can show up situations where a programs from different builds
//! have been mixed up - each program will have its own distinct copy of the
//! version library embedded in it.
//!
