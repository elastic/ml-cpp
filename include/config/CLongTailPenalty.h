//! \brief A penalty for using rare commands with by fields which have many
//! unique or infrequently occurring values.
//!
//! DESCRIPTION:\n
//! If a significant proportion of the count is in by field values which have
//! close to the minimum count, either in terms of distinct over field values
//! which generate them or distinct buckets in which they occur, then rare
//! detectors will fail to detect any anomalies. As such we penalize detectors
//! based on the proportion of count in a tail which is defined as a threshold
//! on the difference between the by field count and the minimum count.
