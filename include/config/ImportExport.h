//! On Windows, it's necessary to explicitly export functions from
//! DLLs.  The simplest way to do this for C++ classes is to add
//! __declspec(dllexport) between the class keyword and the name
//! of the class when declaring it.  However, when using the class
//! from a different DLL or a program, it's necessary that the
//! __declspec(dllimport) modifier.  Since we only want one header
//! file declaring each class, this means that these modifiers
//! have to be held in a macro that expands to __declspec(dllexport)
//! when the DLL containing the class is being built, but to
//! __declspec(dllimport) when other code that uses the class is
//! being built.  On Unix the macro must evaluate to an empty string.
