//! \brief Penalty for the case that counting functions are viewed at a
//! bucket length which is too short relative the data rate.
//!
//! DESCRIPTION:\n
//! If the bucket length is small compared to the mean arrival time then
//! buckets will typically either contain zero or one values and so will
//! not properly capture the variation in arrival times. This penalizes
//! bucket lengths which are less than the shortest bucket length which
//! captures the count distribution at longer bucket lengths.
