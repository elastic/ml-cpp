//! \brief This specifies the interface for assigning a detector a penalty
//! in the range [0.0, 1.0].
//!
//! DESCRIPTION:\n
//! Rather than making hard decisions to keep or discard a detector, which
//! is effectively like having a discontinuous scoring function, auto-
//! configuration assigns each detector a score in the range [0, <max score>].
//! This is achieved by applying a product of smooth penalty functions on
//! the range [0,1], i.e. \f$f_p : D \rightarrow [0,1]\f$, where \f$D\f$ is
//! the set of all detectors for a given set of fields and the map is into,
//! to an initial max score.
//!
//! Note the set of all functions \f$\mathfrak{F} = \{f_p\}\f$ together
//! with the product operation that is \f$f_p * f_p'\f$, of which an example
//! would be \f$d \mapsto f_p(d)f_p'(d)\f$, is an abelian monoid. This means
//! we can get a partial ordering of all detectors by applying products of
//! penalties. It is also worth noting that the product is pointwise monotonic
//! decreasing in its "terms", i.e. for \f$f_p(d) * f_p'(d) \le f_p(d)\f$ for
//! any \f$f_p\f$, \f$f_p'\f$ and \f$d\f$, which implies dominance relations
//! between detectors which have a subset of the penalties which apply to
//! another detector and means as soon as its penalty is zero a detector can
//! be discarded. All the above discussion equally well applies if \f$f_p\f$
//! rounds down onto some finite set of points \f$k\f$ for
//! \f$k \in [\lfloor 1/\eps \rfloor]\f$.
//!
//! IMPLEMENTATION:\n
//! This uses the operator * to implement the product of two penalties
//! since is has the intuitively correct semantics. Note that the result
//! is a closure, i.e. (MyPenaltyA * MyPenaltyB) is a new CPenalty object
//! whose penalty function is the product of the penalty functions of
//! MyPenaltyA and MyPenaltyB.
