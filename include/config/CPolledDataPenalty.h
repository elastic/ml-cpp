//! \brief A penalty for using detectors which have a bucket length shorter
//! than the polling interval for regular data.
//!
//! DESCRIPTION:\n
//! If the data arrive at very uniform intervals then there is no point in
//! having bucket lengths less than the arrival interval. This tests this
//! condition and applies a decreasing penalty based on the number of intervals
//! for which this behavior has been observed.
