# Gets AWS access credentials from Vault.
#
# Designed to be run by sourcing into the script that requires the credentials.
# Requires the jq utility.  Disables command tracing during execution to
# prevent sensitive information getting into the console output.
#
# On success the following environment variables will be set that contain the
# temporary access key and secret key for accessing AWS:
# - ML_AWS_ACCESS_KEY
# - ML_AWS_SECRET_KEY
#
# On failure this script will exit, so will terminate the script that sourced
# it.
#
# It is pointless to run this script in a sub-process - it must be sourced by
# some other script to be of any use.

# Variables named *_PASSWORD, *_SECRET, *_TOKEN, *_ACCESS_KEY & *_SECRET_KEY are redacted in BuildKiteâ€™s environment
