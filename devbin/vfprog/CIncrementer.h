//! \brief
//! Class for measuring function call overhead.
//!
//! DESCRIPTION:\n
//! Class for measuring function call overhead within a shared
//! library.
//!
//! IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS:\n
//! The aim is that the functions do very little - with an ABI
//! that passes arguments in registers no memory access should
//! be required.
//!
