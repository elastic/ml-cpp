=== Enhancements

Perform anomaly detection on features derived from multiple bucket values to improve robustness
of detection with respect to misconfigured bucket lengths and improve detection of long lasting
anomalies. (See {pull}175[#175].)

Increased independence of anomaly scores across partitions ({pull}182[182])  

Avoid potential false positives at model start up when first detecting new components of the time
series decomposition. (See {pull}218[218].)

=== Bug Fixes

Fix cause of "Bad density value..." log errors whilst forecasting. ({pull}207[207])

Fix incorrectly missing influencers when the influence field is one of the detector's partitioning
fields and the bucket is empty. ({pull}219[#219])
