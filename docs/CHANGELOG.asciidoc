=== Enhancements

Perform anomaly detection on features derived from multiple bucket values to improve robustness
of detection with respect to misconfigured bucket lengths and improve detection of long lasting
anomalies. (See {ml-pull}175[#175].)

Support decomposing a time series into a piecewise linear trend and with piecewise constant
scaling of the periodic components. This extends our decomposition functionality to handle the
same types of change points that our modelling capabilities do. (See {ml-pull}198[198].)

Increased independence of anomaly scores across partitions (See {ml-pull}182[182].)

Avoid potential false positives at model start up when first detecting new components of the time
series decomposition. (See {ml-pull}218[218].)

=== Bug Fixes

Fix cause of "Bad density value..." log errors whilst forecasting. ({ml-pull}207[207])

Fix incorrectly missing influencers when the influence field is one of the detector's partitioning
fields and the bucket is empty. ({pull}219[#219])
