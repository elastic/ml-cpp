== {es} version 7.6.0

=== Enhancements

* Improve performance of boosted tree training for both classification and regression.
(See {ml-pull}775[#775].)
* Reduce the peak memory used by boosted tree training and fix an overcounting bug
estimating maximum memory usage. (See {ml-pull}781[#781].)
* Stratified fractional cross validation for regression. (See {ml-pull}784[#784].)
* Added `geo_point` supported output for `lat_long` function records. (See {ml-pull}809[#809], {pull}47050[#47050].)

== {es} version 7.5.0

=== Enhancements

* Improve performance and concurrency training boosted tree regression models.
For large data sets this change was observed to give a 10% to 20% decrease in
train time. (See {ml-pull}622[#622].)
* Upgrade Boost libraries to version 1.71. (See {ml-pull}638[#638].)
* Improve initialisation of boosted tree training. This generally enables us to
find lower loss models faster. (See {ml-pull}686[#686].)
* Include a smooth tree depth based penalty to regularized objective function for
boosted tree training. Hard depth based regularization is often the strategy of
choice to prevent over fitting for XGBoost. By smoothing we can make better tradeoffs.
Also, the parameters of the penalty function are mode suited to optimising with our
Bayesian optimisation based hyperparameter search. (See {ml-pull}698[#698].)
* Binomial logistic regression targeting cross entropy. (See {ml-pull}713[#713].) 
* Improvements to count and sum anomaly detection for sparse data. This primarily
aims to improve handling of data which are predictably present: detecting when they
are unexpectedly missing. (See {ml-pull}721[#721].)
* Trap numeric errors causing bad hyperparameter search initialisation and repeated
errors to be logged during boosted tree training. (See {ml-pull}732[#732].)

== {es} version 7.4.1

=== Enhancements

* The {ml} native processes are now arranged in a .app directory structure on
  macOS, to allow for notarization on macOS Catalina. (See {ml-pull}593[#593].)

=== Bug Fixes

* A reference to a temporary variable was causing forecast model restoration to fail.
The bug exhibited itself on MacOS builds with versions of clangd > 10.0.0. (See {ml-pull}688[#688].)

== {es} version 7.4.0

=== Bug Fixes

* Rename outlier detection method values knn and tnn to distance_kth_nn and distance_knn
respectively to match the API. (See {ml-pull}598[#598].)
* Fix occasional (non-deterministic) reinitialisation of modelling for the lat_long
function. (See {ml-pull}641[#641].)

== {es} version 7.3.1

=== Bug Fixes

* Only trap the case that more rows are supplied to outlier detection than expected.
Previously, if rows were excluded from the data frame after supplying the row count
in the configuration then we detected the inconsistency and failed outlier detection.
However, this legitimately happens in case where the field values are non-numeric or
array valued. (See {ml-pull}569[#569].)

== {es} version 7.3.0

=== Enhancements

* Upgrade to a newer version of the Apache Portable Runtime library. (See {ml-pull}495[#495].)
* Improve stability of modelling around change points. (See {ml-pull}496[#496].)

=== Bug Fixes

* Reduce false positives associated with the multi-bucket feature. (See {ml-pull}491[#491].)
* Reduce false positives for sum and count functions on sparse data. (See {ml-pull}492[#492].)

== {es} version 7.2.1

=== Bug Fixes

* Fix an edge case causing spurious anomalies (false positives) if the variance in the count of events
changed significantly throughout the period of a seasonal quantity. (See {ml-pull}489[#489].)

== {es} version 7.2.0

=== Enhancements

* Remove hard limit for maximum forecast interval and limit based on the time interval of data added
to the model. (See {ml-pull}214[#214].)

* Use hardened compiler options to build 3rd party libraries. (See {ml-pull}453[#453].)

* Only select more complex trend models for forecasting if there is evidence that they are needed.
(See {ml-pull}463[#463].)

* Improve residual model selection. (See {ml-pull}468[#468].)

* Stop linking to libcrypt on Linux. (See {ml-pull}480[#480].)

* Improvements to hard_limit audit message. (See {ml-pull}486[#486].)

=== Bug Fixes

* Handle NaNs when detrending seasonal components. {ml-pull}408[#408]

== {es} version 7.0.0-alpha2

=== Bug Fixes

* Fixes CPoissonMeanConjugate sampling error. {ml-pull}335[#335]
//NOTE: Remove from final 7.0.0 release notes if already in 6.x

* Ensure statics are persisted in a consistent manner {ml-pull}360[#360]

== {es} version 7.0.0-alpha1

== {es} version 6.8.4

=== Bug Fixes

* A reference to a temporary variable was causing forecast model restoration to fail.
The bug exhibited itself on MacOS builds with versions of clangd > 10.0.0. (See {ml-pull}688[#688].)

== {es} version 6.8.2

=== Bug Fixes

* Don't write model size stats when job is closed without any input {ml-pull}512[#512] (issue: {ml-issue}394[#394])
* Don't persist model state at the end of lookback if the lookback did not generate any input {ml-pull}521[#521] (issue: {ml-issue}519[#519])

== {es} version 6.7.2

=== Enhancements

* Adjust seccomp filter to allow the "time" system call {ml-pull}459[#459]

== {es} version 6.7.0

=== Bug Fixes

* Improve autodetect logic for persistence. {ml-pull}437[#437]

== {es} version 6.6.2

=== Enhancements

* Adjust seccomp filter for Fedora 29. {ml-pull}354[#354]

=== Bug Fixes

* Fixes an issue where interim results would be calculated after advancing time into an empty bucket. {ml-pull}416[#416]
