== {es} version 6.8.12

=== Bug Fixes

* Fix restoration of change detectors after seasonality change. (See {ml-pull}1391[#1391].)

== {es} version 6.8.11

=== Bug Fixes

* Better interrupt handling during named pipe connection. (See {ml-pull}1311[#1311].)
* Trap potential cause of SIGFPE. (See {ml-pull}1351[#1351], issue: {ml-issue}1348[#1348].)

== {es} version 6.8.7

=== Bug Fixes

* Include out-of-order as well as in-order terms in categorization reverse searches.
(See {ml-pull}950[#950], issue: {ml-issue}949[#949].)

== {es} version 6.8.5

=== Enhancements

* The {ml} native processes are now arranged in a .app directory structure on
  macOS, to allow for notarization on macOS Catalina. (See {ml-pull}593[#593].)

=== Bug Fixes

* Restore from checkpoint could damage seasonality modeling. For example, it could
  cause seasonal components to be overwritten in error. (See {ml-pull}821[#821].)

== {es} version 6.8.4

=== Bug Fixes

* A reference to a temporary variable was causing forecast model restoration to fail.
The bug exhibited itself on MacOS builds with versions of clangd > 10.0.0. (See {ml-pull}688[#688].)

== {es} version 6.8.2

=== Bug Fixes

* Don't write model size stats when job is closed without any input {ml-pull}512[#512] (issue: {ml-issue}394[#394])
* Don't persist model state at the end of lookback if the lookback did not generate any input {ml-pull}521[#521] (issue: {ml-issue}519[#519])

 == {es} version 6.7.2

=== Enhancements

* Adjust seccomp filter to allow the "time" system call {ml-pull}459[#459]

 == {es} version 6.7.0

=== Breaking Changes

=== Deprecations

=== New Features

=== Enhancements

Adjust seccomp filter for Fedora 29. {ml-pull}354[#354]

=== Bug Fixes

* Improve autodetect logic for persistence. {ml-pull}437[#437]

 == {es} version 6.6.2

=== Bug Fixes

* Fixes an issue where interim results would be calculated after advancing time into an empty bucket. {ml-pull}416[#416]

 == {es} version 6.6.0

=== Breaking Changes

=== Deprecations

=== New Features

=== Enhancements

=== Bug Fixes

Fix cause of "Sample out of bounds" error message (See {ml-pull}355[355].}

=== Regressions

 == {es} version 6.5.5

=== Bug Fixes

Fix a race condition if a forecast job requires overflowing to disk but cleanup of temporary
storage fails. This can cause the autodetect process to hang on exit, if more forecast requests
are in the queue. (See {ml-pull}352[352].)

 == {es} version 6.5.3

=== Bug Fixes

Correct query times for model plot and forecast in the bucket to match the times we assign
the samples we add to the model for each bucket. For long bucket lengths, this could result
in apparently shifted model plot with respect to the data and increased errors in forecasts.

 == {es} version 6.5.0

//=== Breaking Changes

//=== Deprecations

//=== New Features

=== Enhancements

Perform anomaly detection on features derived from multiple bucket values to improve robustness
of detection with respect to misconfigured bucket lengths and improve detection of long lasting
anomalies. (See {ml-pull}175[#175].)

Support decomposing a time series into a piecewise linear trend and with piecewise constant
scaling of the periodic components. This extends our decomposition functionality to handle the
same types of change points that our modelling capabilities do. (See {ml-pull}198[198].)

Increased independence of anomaly scores across partitions (See {ml-pull}182[182].)

Avoid potential false positives at model start up when first detecting new components of the time
series decomposition. (See {ml-pull}218[218].)

Add a new label - multi_bucket_impact - to record level anomaly results.
The value will be on a scale of -5 to +5 where -5 means the anomaly is purely single bucket
and +5 means the anomaly is purely multi bucket. ({ml-pull}230[230])

Improve our ability to detect change points in the presence of outliers. (See {ml-pull}265[265].)

=== Bug Fixes

Fix cause of "Bad density value..." log errors whilst forecasting. ({ml-pull}207[207])

Fix incorrectly missing influencers when the influence field is one of the detector's partitioning
fields and the bucket is empty. ({pull}219[#219])

Fix cause of hard_limit memory error for jobs with bucket span greater than one day. ({ml-pull}243[243])

Fix cause of "Failed to compute significance..." log errors ({ml-pull}272[272])"

Prevent detecting a trend component during a possible change in the time series. The resulting
model was poorly reinitialised in this case which damaged anomaly detection for some time. (See
{ml-pull}287[#287].)

Fix cause of "MERGE: Sum mode samples = 0, total samples = 4.43521.." log errors ({ml-pull}294[294])

== {es} version 6.4.3

//=== Breaking Changes

//=== Deprecations

//=== New Features

=== Enhancements

* Changes linker options on macOS to allow Homebrew installs ({ml-pull}225[#225])

//=== Bug Fixes

* Fixes the cause of `hard_limit` memory errors for jobs with bucket spans greater
than one day ({ml-pull}243[#243])
* Rules that trigger the `skip_model_update` action should also apply to the
anomaly model. This fixes an issue where anomaly scores of results that triggered
the rule would decrease if they occurred frequently. {ml-pull}222[#222] (issue:{ml-issue}217[#217])
