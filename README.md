# Machine Learning for the Elastic Stack

<https://www.elastic.co/products/x-pack>

The ml-cpp repo is a part of Machine Learning for X-Pack and is available with
either a trial or platinum license for the
[Elastic Stack](https://www.elastic.co/products).

This repo only contains the the C++ code that implements the core analytics for
machine learning.

Code for integrating into the Elastic Stack and source for its documentation can
be found in the main
[elasticsearch repo](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch).

## Elastic License Functionality

Most files in this repository are subject to the Elastic License. The full
license can be found in [LICENSE.txt](LICENSE.txt). Usage requires a
[subscription](https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions). Files that are not
subject to the Elastic License are in the [3rd_party](3rd_party) and
[build-setup](build-setup) directories.

## Getting Started

Before starting with Machine Learning for X-Pack, it's a good idea to get some
experience with the
[Elastic Stack](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elastic-stack/current/index.html)
first.

To get started with Machine Learning please have a look at

## Setting up a build environment

You don't need to specifically build the C++ components for machine learning as,
by default, the elasticsearch build will download pre-compiled C++ artifacts.

Setting up a build environment for ml-cpp native code is complex. If you are
specifically interested in working with the ml-cpp code, then information
regarding setting up a build environment can be found in the
[build-setup](build-setup) directory.
