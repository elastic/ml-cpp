//! \brief
//! Cancels blocking IO in one thread if a stream reaches end-of-file.
//!
//! DESCRIPTION:\n
//! Reads from the supplied stream until end-of-file is reached.  Then
//! cancels blocking IO calls in another thread.
//!
//! If this thread is shut down before end-of-file is reached on the
//! supplied stream then the shutdown function cancels reading of the
//! supplied stream.
//!
//! IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS:\n
//! Designed to handle the following sequence of events:
//! 1) Java process spawns this process
//! 2) This process creates named pipes for logging and to receive commands
//! 3) Before connecting the named pipes, the Java process dies
//!
//! In this situation this process will receive end-of-file on its STDIN,
//! but will be blocked opening one of the named pipes.  The blocking call
//! needs to be cancelled to allow this process to exit gracefully.
//!
