//! \brief
//! Processes commands received on a C++ stream.
//!
//! DESCRIPTION:\n
//! Reads from the supplied stream until end-of-file is reached.
//!
//! Each (newline terminated) line is assumed to be a tab-separated
//! command to be executed.
//!
//! Each command has the following format:
//! ID verb arguments...
//!
//! The ID is expected to be a unique positive integer.  This is reported
//! in error messages and in the response objects that are sent when the
//! command is complete.
//!
//! Available verbs are:
//! 1) start - in this case the arguments consist of the process name
//!    followed by the arguments to pass to the new process
//! 2) kill - in this case the argument is the PID of the process to kill
//!
//! IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS:\n
//! Commands are case sensitive.
//!
//! Only processes on a supplied list may be executed; requests to start
//! other processes are ignored.
//!
//! Only processes started by this controller may be killed; requests to
//! kill other processes are ignored.
//!
