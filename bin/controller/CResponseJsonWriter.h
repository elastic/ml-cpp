//! \brief
//! Write a response to a controller command in JSON format.
//!
//! DESCRIPTION:\n
//! Output documents are of the form:
//!
//! { "id" : 123, "success" : true, "reason" : "message explaining success/failure" }
//!
//! They are written into a JSON array, i.e. the overall output looks
//! something like this:
//!
//! [{ "id" : 1, "success" : true, "reason" : "all ok" }
//! ,{ "id" : 2, "success" : false, "reason" : "something went wrong" }
//! ,{ "id" : 3, "success" : true, "reason" : "ok again" }
//! ]
//!
//! IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS:\n
//! Uses the concurrent line writer.  There's no need for thread safety
//! with the current design, but in future commands might be processed
//! concurrently.
//!
