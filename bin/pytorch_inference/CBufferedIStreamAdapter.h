//! \brief
//! A buffered stream implementation of ReadAdapterInterface
//! for reading TorchScript models (.pt files).
//!
//! DESCRIPTION:\n
//! TorchScript model readers require seek and tell type
//! functionality which is not provided in all input streams.
//! The entire model is read into a buffer to support this.
//!
//! The max supported model size is 4GB limited by the 32 bit number
//! the size is serialized as.
//!
//! See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/master/caffe2/serialize/inline_container.h
//! for details of the serialized TorchScript model format.
//!
//! IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS:\n
//! First reads the size of the model file from the stream
//! then allocates a buffer large enough to hold the model
//! definition and reads the model into that buffer.
//!
