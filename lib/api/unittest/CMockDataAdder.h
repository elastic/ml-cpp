//! \brief
//! Mock data adder for unit testing.
//!
//! DESCRIPTION:\n
//! The CDataAdder class can add data into a live ES instance,
//! but for unit testing it's desirable to mock this class.
//!
//! IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS:\n
//!

public:
    using TStrVec = std::vector<std::string>;

public:
    CMockDataAdder();

    //! Add streamed data - return of NULL stream indicates failure.
    //! Since the data to be written isn't known at the time this function
    //! returns it is not possible to detect all error conditions
    //! immediately.  If the stream goes bad whilst being written to then
    //! this also indicates failure.
    TOStreamP addStreamed(const std::string& id) override;

    //! Clients that get a stream using addStreamed() must call this
    //! method one they've finished sending data to the stream.
    //! They should set force to true when the very last stream is
    //! complete, in case the persister needs to close off some
    //! sort of cached data structure.
