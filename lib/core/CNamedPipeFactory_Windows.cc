    // permitted.  On Windows, the first time this check is made for any given
    // file name, the file is opened.  For named pipes this unfortunately means
    // that the server side of the named pipe will see a very short-lived
    // connection followed by end-of-file.  When this happens we need to
    // disconnect the short-lived pipe to the security manager and reconnect to
    // the file that will back the Java FileInputStream or FileOutputStream.
    // This cannot be as simple as just always disconnecting and reconnecting
    // once, because this leads to a race condition: we cannot guarantee that
    // the security manager's spurious file open will occur while this code is
    // trying to connect.  Sometimes the security manager can try to open the
    // pipe before this code calls the ConnectNamedPipe() function, but then
    // the real file open on the Java side comes after the ConnectNamedPipe()
    // call has started.  In this case there is no short-lived connection.  To
    // cope with this we wait a short time after a connection and then try to
    // write to the pipe to check whether it's still open on the remote side.
    // This means that all Java code that reads from Ml named pipes must
