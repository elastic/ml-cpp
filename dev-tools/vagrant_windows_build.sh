# The code is made available in the VM via a VirtualBox synced folder.  However,
# the Visual C++ compiler doesn't work on a case sensitive file system and
# the VirtualBox synced folder is case sensitive, so we copy it to a normal
# folder for building.  If the normal folder exists on the VM it's removed
# first.  This means that the VM can be reused without having to be provisioned
# on every build.  (Provisioning the VM for the first time is very slow.)
