# The part of ML C++ CI that cross compiles platforms that are not going to be

# This script must run on linux-x86_64, as that is always the host OS for our
# cross compilation.
#
# 1. If this is not a PR build nor a debug build, obtain credentials from Vault
#    for the accessing S3
# 2. If this is a PR build, check the code style
# 3. Cross compile the darwin-x86_64 build of the C++
# 4. If this is not a PR build, cross compile the linux-aarch64 build of the C++
# 5. If this is not a PR build nor a debug build, upload the builds to the
#    artifacts directory on S3 that subsequent Java builds will download the C++
#    components from
#
# All steps run in Docker containers that ensure OS dependencies are appropriate
# given the support matrix.
#
# Cross-compiled platforms cannot be unit tested.
