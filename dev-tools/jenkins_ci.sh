# The non-Windows part of ML C++ CI does the following:
#
# 1. If this is not a PR build nor a debug build, obtain credentials from Vault
#    for the accessing S3
# 2. Build and unit test the C++ on the native architecture
# 3. For Linux PR builds, also run some Java integration tests using the newly
#    built C++ code
# 4. If this is not a PR build nor a debug build, upload the builds to the
#    artifacts directory on S3 that subsequent Java builds will download the C++
#    components from
#
# On Linux all steps run in Docker containers that ensure OS dependencies
# are appropriate given the support matrix.
#
# On macOS the build runs on the native machine, but downloads dependencies
# that were previously built on a reference build server.  However, care still
# needs to be taken that the machines running this script are set up
# appropriately for generating builds for redistribution.
