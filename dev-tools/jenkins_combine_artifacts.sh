# The post-processing step of ML C++ CI does the following:
#
# 1. Download the platform-specific artifacts built by the the first phase
#    of the ML CI job.
# 2. Combine the platform-specific artifacts into an all-platforms bundle,
#    as used by the Elasticsearch build.
# 3. Upload the all-platforms bundle to S3, where day-to-day Elasticsearch
#    builds will download it from.
# 4. Upload all artifacts, both platform-specific and all-platforms, to
#    GCS, where release manager builds will download them from.
